    ******************
    title = "What is perhaps most striking about the 32 photographs that make up Jack Lueders-
    Booth's new book, “Women Prisoner Polaroids,” is the intimacy that occupies each frame. Inmates wear their
    own clothes and pose in cells embellished with personal effects, much like any regular college dorm room;
    one woman clasps a biography of Mick Jagger, others are pictured with their arms wrapped around friends. A
    warm sensibility, typically foreign to portraits of incarceration, is notable throughout."
